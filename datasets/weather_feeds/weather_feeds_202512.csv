Sri Lanka has experienced a rare November cyclone landfall; only the 5th recorded and the first since 1992. Tropical Storm Ditwah, reaching 40 mph (65 km/h) and 1,001 mbar, is moving across the island and has already triggered devastating landslides and dangerous flash floods.
Tragically, 47 lives have been lost, and more than 25 people remain unaccounted for.
At the same time, Tropical Depression Senyar, located about 1,400 miles (2,250 km) to the east, continues to bring heavy flooding to Sumatra and Malaysia.

In the latest severe windstorm that struck Sri Lanka, approximately 7.16% of the population has been affected, marking one of the most significant climate related events in recent years. The devastation has resulted in 465 confirmed deaths, with 366 individuals still reported missing.
Beyond the heartbreaking human loss, thousands of families have been displaced, infrastructure has been damaged, and essential services across multiple districts have been disrupted. This tragedy highlights a growing reality: extreme weather events are no longer rare they are becoming the new normal.
My thoughts and prayers are with all the affected families. Let us stand together in contributing to relief efforts and advocating for stronger climate resilience across the country.

Sri Lanka has experienced a rare November cyclone landfall; only the 5th recorded and the first since 1992. Tropical Storm Ditwah, reaching 40 mph (65 km/h) and 1,001 mbar, is moving across the island and has already triggered devastating landslides and dangerous flash floods.
Tragically, 47 lives have been lost, and more than 25 people remain unaccounted for.
At the same time, Tropical Depression Senyar, located about 1,400 miles (2,250 km) to the east, continues to bring heavy flooding to Sumatra and Malaysia.

In the latest severe windstorm that struck Sri Lanka, approximately 7.16% of the population has been affected, marking one of the most significant climate related events in recent years. The devastation has resulted in 465 confirmed deaths, with 366 individuals still reported missing.
Beyond the heartbreaking human loss, thousands of families have been displaced, infrastructure has been damaged, and essential services across multiple districts have been disrupted. This tragedy highlights a growing reality: extreme weather events are no longer rare they are becoming the new normal.
My thoughts and prayers are with all the affected families. Let us stand together in contributing to relief efforts and advocating for stronger climate resilience across the country.

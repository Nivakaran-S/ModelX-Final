Over the past few days, Sri Lanka has been hit by one of the most devastating weather events in recent years. Entire communities are underwater. Roads have disappeared. Families have been displaced overnight. And tragically, we have lost lives lives that will never return, leaving families with grief that words cannot ease.
As I scroll through the images and updates, it feels overwhelming. Homes washed away. Children carried through floods. Elderly people waiting for rescue. People stranded without power, food, or safety. It’s a reminder of how fragile life is and how quickly ordinary routines can turn into survival.
Yet in the midst of this destruction, something powerful is emerging: 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒆𝒏𝒈𝒕𝒉 𝒐𝒇 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝑺𝒓𝒊 𝑳𝒂𝒏𝒌𝒂𝒏 𝒔𝒑𝒊𝒓𝒊𝒕.
Rescue workers, military personnel, medical teams, and volunteers are risking their lives in dangerous conditions. Communities are opening doors to strangers. People are sharing food, water, and shelter. In moments like this, humanity becomes the greatest form of leadership.
But this crisis is not only personal - it is national.
The floods are disrupting:
🔹Daily travel and school routines
🔹Businesses, supply chains, and agriculture
🔹Livelihoods of thousands who depend on daily work
🔹Infrastructure that will take months to repair
This is bigger than a weather update. This is a call for compassion, responsibility, and solidarity.
Today, more than ever, we must:
🔹Put 𝒔𝒂𝒇𝒆𝒕𝒚 𝒃𝒆𝒇𝒐𝒓𝒆 𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒚𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒈
🔹Support verified relief efforts
🔹Check on employees, colleagues, neighbours
🔹Offer help where we can, even in small ways
🔹Use our platforms to spread awareness, not panic
If there is one thing Sri Lanka has always shown the world, it’s resilience. We bend, but we do not break.

From the hills of South India to the temples of Sri Lanka and the islands of Southeast Asia, walking barefoot on burning embers is seen as a sacred trial, a rite of passage, a cleansing ritual, and a bold act of surrender to the divine.

These two images capture two powerful expressions of the fire-walking tradition — performed during festivals with deep cultural and spiritual roots.

Yes, we need to be empathetic, no two words about that, but cancelling preplanned events, Christmas sales is certainly not the way to go about things.
This is precisely the time we need to support our industries, especially small and medium-sized businesses. With cancellations, how can daily wage earners, suppliers, food stall owners, and entertainers (who count on the season especially to sustain them) and their families survive?
Venues have been booked, bands and event management companies have reserved their dates, money has been spent on decor, stalls have been reserved, and food items for stalls have been procured.
The economy cannot stand still.
We need to recover from this fast folks!

Over the past few days, Sri Lanka has been hit by one of the most devastating weather events in recent years. Entire communities are underwater. Roads have disappeared. Families have been displaced overnight. And tragically, we have lost lives lives that will never return, leaving families with grief that words cannot ease.
As I scroll through the images and updates, it feels overwhelming. Homes washed away. Children carried through floods. Elderly people waiting for rescue. People stranded without power, food, or safety. It’s a reminder of how fragile life is and how quickly ordinary routines can turn into survival.
Yet in the midst of this destruction, something powerful is emerging: 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒆𝒏𝒈𝒕𝒉 𝒐𝒇 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝑺𝒓𝒊 𝑳𝒂𝒏𝒌𝒂𝒏 𝒔𝒑𝒊𝒓𝒊𝒕.
Rescue workers, military personnel, medical teams, and volunteers are risking their lives in dangerous conditions. Communities are opening doors to strangers. People are sharing food, water, and shelter. In moments like this, humanity becomes the greatest form of leadership.
But this crisis is not only personal - it is national.
The floods are disrupting:
🔹Daily travel and school routines
🔹Businesses, supply chains, and agriculture
🔹Livelihoods of thousands who depend on daily work
🔹Infrastructure that will take months to repair
This is bigger than a weather update. This is a call for compassion, responsibility, and solidarity.
Today, more than ever, we must:
🔹Put 𝒔𝒂𝒇𝒆𝒕𝒚 𝒃𝒆𝒇𝒐𝒓𝒆 𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒚𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒈
🔹Support verified relief efforts
🔹Check on employees, colleagues, neighbours
🔹Offer help where we can, even in small ways
🔹Use our platforms to spread awareness, not panic
If there is one thing Sri Lanka has always shown the world, it’s resilience. We bend, but we do not break.
""𝐖𝐞 𝐟𝐚𝐥𝐥, 𝐛𝐮𝐭 𝐰𝐞 𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐞 𝐭𝐨𝐠𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫.""
As the nation continues to navigate this crisis, may we hold onto what truly matters people, humanity, kindness, and unity.

Over the past few days, Sri Lanka has been hit by one of the most devastating weather events in recent years. Entire communities are underwater. Roads have disappeared. Families have been displaced overnight. And tragically, we have lost lives lives that will never return, leaving families with grief that words cannot ease.
As I scroll through the images and updates, it feels overwhelming. Homes washed away. Children carried through floods. Elderly people waiting for rescue. People stranded without power, food, or safety. It’s a reminder of how fragile life is and how quickly ordinary routines can turn into survival.
Yet in the midst of this destruction, something powerful is emerging: 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒆𝒏𝒈𝒕𝒉 𝒐𝒇 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝑺𝒓𝒊 𝑳𝒂𝒏𝒌𝒂𝒏 𝒔𝒑𝒊𝒓𝒊𝒕.
Rescue workers, military personnel, medical teams, and volunteers are risking their lives in dangerous conditions. Communities are opening doors to strangers. People are sharing food, water, and shelter. In moments like this, humanity becomes the greatest form of leadership.
But this crisis is not only personal - it is national.
The floods are disrupting:
🔹Daily travel and school routines
🔹Businesses, supply chains, and agriculture
🔹Livelihoods of thousands who depend on daily work
🔹Infrastructure that will take months to repair
This is bigger than a weather update. This is a call for compassion, responsibility, and solidarity.
Today, more than ever, we must:
🔹Put 𝒔𝒂𝒇𝒆𝒕𝒚 𝒃𝒆𝒇𝒐𝒓𝒆 𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒚𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒈
🔹Support verified relief efforts
🔹Check on employees, colleagues, neighbours
🔹Offer help where we can, even in small ways
🔹Use our platforms to spread awareness, not panic

From the hills of South India to the temples of Sri Lanka and the islands of Southeast Asia, walking barefoot on burning embers is seen as a sacred trial, a rite of passage, a cleansing ritual, and a bold act of surrender to the divine.

These two images capture two powerful expressions of the fire-walking tradition — performed during festivals with deep cultural and spiritual roots.

Yes, we need to be empathetic, no two words about that, but cancelling preplanned events, Christmas sales is certainly not the way to go about things.
This is precisely the time we need to support our industries, especially small and medium-sized businesses. With cancellations, how can daily wage earners, suppliers, food stall owners, and entertainers (who count on the season especially to sustain them) and their families survive?
Venues have been booked, bands and event management companies have reserved their dates, money has been spent on decor, stalls have been reserved, and food items for stalls have been procured.
The economy cannot stand still.
We need to recover from this fast folks!

Over the past few days, Sri Lanka has been hit by one of the most devastating weather events in recent years. Entire communities are underwater. Roads have disappeared. Families have been displaced overnight. And tragically, we have lost lives lives that will never return, leaving families with grief that words cannot ease.
As I scroll through the images and updates, it feels overwhelming. Homes washed away. Children carried through floods. Elderly people waiting for rescue. People stranded without power, food, or safety. It’s a reminder of how fragile life is and how quickly ordinary routines can turn into survival.
Yet in the midst of this destruction, something powerful is emerging: 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒆𝒏𝒈𝒕𝒉 𝒐𝒇 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝑺𝒓𝒊 𝑳𝒂𝒏𝒌𝒂𝒏 𝒔𝒑𝒊𝒓𝒊𝒕.
Rescue workers, military personnel, medical teams, and volunteers are risking their lives in dangerous conditions. Communities are opening doors to strangers. People are sharing food, water, and shelter. In moments like this, humanity becomes the greatest form of leadership.
But this crisis is not only personal - it is national.
The floods are disrupting:
🔹Daily travel and school routines
🔹Businesses, supply chains, and agriculture
🔹Livelihoods of thousands who depend on daily work
🔹Infrastructure that will take months to repair
This is bigger than a weather update. This is a call for compassion, responsibility, and solidarity.
Today, more than ever, we must:
🔹Put 𝒔𝒂𝒇𝒆𝒕𝒚 𝒃𝒆𝒇𝒐𝒓𝒆 𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒚𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒈
🔹Support verified relief efforts
🔹Check on employees, colleagues, neighbours
🔹Offer help where we can, even in small ways
🔹Use our platforms to spread awareness, not panic
If there is one thing Sri Lanka has always shown the world, it’s resilience. We bend, but we do not break.
""𝐖𝐞 𝐟𝐚𝐥𝐥, 𝐛𝐮𝐭 𝐰𝐞 𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐞 𝐭𝐨𝐠𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫.""
As the nation continues to navigate this crisis, may we hold onto what truly matters people, humanity, kindness, and unity.

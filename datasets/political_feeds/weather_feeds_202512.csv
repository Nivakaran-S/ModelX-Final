Let’s stand through this storm, hold one another tight, and rise stronger.

To everyone affected: my thoughts, my prayers, and my heart are with you.
To the rest of the world: your prayers and kindness mean more than words can express.

Recent extreme weather may lead to adjustments in travel plans, and we’re reviewing everything carefully from day to day.

But most important:  Do NOT cancel!

The south coast remains safe, with sunshine, calm beaches and normal transport to and from the airport 🌴☀️

(The sunny photo posted is from Hikkaduwa NOW - today! )

Journeys to Ella and Kandy are on pause for the next three days while conditions settle.  After that, we’ll reassess and update everyone.

It’s still far too early to predict anything beyond the first week of December. We’re here on the ground, monitoring the situation closely and sharing honest updates as soon as we have them.

@affinityfoundationlk have opened a disaster relief meal center and are making packs for people affected. Visit their profile to see how you can help.

Other organizations that are raising funds and/or collecting dry rations donations:

=========
Over the past five days — that’s about 120 hours — Ennore and its nearby regions have recorded an impressive 717 mm of rainfall. Even within the last 96 hours, around 616 mm of rain has fallen due to the remnants of Cyclone DITWAH. 

As expected, the system’s intensity has now weakened significantly.We can currently observe patches of rain clouds forming over the coastal waters near the northern coastal districts, leading to on and off light/moderate rainfall in some areas. This pattern resembles the typical easterly wind-driven rainfall seen during the Northeast Monsoon season, strengthened by the circulation’s westward movement.

In Puducherry, about 26 mm of rainfall has been recorded in the past 24 hours.

Looking ahead, occasional heavy rains are likely in Delta districts, southern Tamil Nadu, and parts of Sri Lanka during this December period. Meanwhile, convective systems over the Equatorial southern Indian Ocean are beginning to intensify. This means upcoming disturbances forming over the western Pacific may move into the southern Bay of Bengal and be drawn further south.Depending on the impact of western disturbances, isolated rain chances could again develop over parts of the northern coastal districts in the coming days.

Since it’s quite challenging to describe these technical patterns textually, more detailed updates will be shared as strong rain possibilities emerge.

Stay tuned —
Your #Emmanuel🙏

=========
Over the past five days — that’s about 120 hours — Ennore and its nearby regions have recorded an impressive 717 mm of rainfall. Even within the last 96 hours, around 616 mm of rain has fallen due to the remnants of Cyclone DITWAH. 

As expected, the system’s intensity has now weakened significantly.We can currently observe patches of rain clouds forming over the coastal waters near the northern coastal districts, leading to on and off light/moderate rainfall in some areas. This pattern resembles the typical easterly wind-driven rainfall seen during the Northeast Monsoon season, strengthened by the circulation’s westward movement.

In Puducherry, about 26 mm of rainfall has been recorded in the past 24 hours.

Looking ahead, occasional heavy rains are likely in Delta districts, southern Tamil Nadu, and parts of Sri Lanka during this December period. Meanwhile, convective systems over the Equatorial southern Indian Ocean are beginning to intensify. This means upcoming disturbances forming over the western Pacific may move into the southern Bay of Bengal and be drawn further south.Depending on the impact of western disturbances, isolated rain chances could again develop over parts of the northern coastal districts in the coming days.

Since it’s quite challenging to describe these technical patterns textually, more detailed updates will be shared as strong rain possibilities emerge.

Stay tuned —
Your #Emmanuel🙏

Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), under the direction of President Mr. Shammi Silva and the Executive Committee, have decided to donate Rs. 300 million to the Government’s ‘Rebuilding Sri Lanka’ Fund.
This decision reflects SLC’s deep sense of responsibility as an iconic national sporting body representing a game cherished by millions of Sri Lankans.
SLC is confident that this contribution will support the Government in delivering emergency relief to families affected by Cyclone Ditwah, and in restoring essential public services needed to rebuild the daily lives of impacted communities.
Furthermore, Sri Lanka Cricket, its President Mr. Shammi Silva, and the Executive Committee reiterate that SLC will continue to stand by the nation and extend its support whenever needed, as part of its commitment to the country’s progress.

💛Here’s what you need to know: 

Recent extreme weather may lead to adjustments in travel plans, and we’re reviewing everything carefully from day to day.

But most important:  Do NOT cancel!

The south coast remains safe, with sunshine, calm beaches and normal transport to and from the airport 🌴☀️

(The sunny photo posted is from Hikkaduwa NOW - today! )

Journeys to Ella and Kandy are on pause for the next three days while conditions settle.  After that, we’ll reassess and update everyone.

It’s still far too early to predict anything beyond the first week of December. We’re here on the ground, monitoring the situation closely and sharing honest updates as soon as we have them.

Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), under the direction of President Mr. Shammi Silva and the Executive Committee, have decided to donate Rs. 300 million to the Government’s ‘Rebuilding Sri Lanka’ Fund.
This decision reflects SLC’s deep sense of responsibility as an iconic national sporting body representing a game cherished by millions of Sri Lankans.
SLC is confident that this contribution will support the Government in delivering emergency relief to families affected by Cyclone Ditwah, and in restoring essential public services needed to rebuild the daily lives of impacted communities.
Furthermore, Sri Lanka Cricket, its President Mr. Shammi Silva, and the Executive Committee reiterate that SLC will continue to stand by the nation and extend its support whenever needed, as part of its commitment to the country’s progress.

💛Here’s what you need to know: 

Recent extreme weather may lead to adjustments in travel plans, and we’re reviewing everything carefully from day to day.

But most important:  Do NOT cancel!

The south coast remains safe, with sunshine, calm beaches and normal transport to and from the airport 🌴☀️

(The sunny photo posted is from Hikkaduwa NOW - today! )

Journeys to Ella and Kandy are on pause for the next three days while conditions settle.  After that, we’ll reassess and update everyone.

It’s still far too early to predict anything beyond the first week of December. We’re here on the ground, monitoring the situation closely and sharing honest updates as soon as we have them.

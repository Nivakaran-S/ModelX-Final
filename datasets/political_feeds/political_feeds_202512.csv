Didnt Anura Kumara qoute Gandhi in his first address to the nation ""Greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated""❓ 
Now we can judge the greatness and moral progress of @anurakumaraofficial

This Government believes the recent animal census where 2,600,000 Giant Squirrels were counted in just 300 seconds by naked eyes, by ordinary people with no experience in wildlife. How Is this realistic❓

If this is how they intend to Govern the country not only animals but even the human will be in alot of trouble.

Didnt Anura Kumara qoute Gandhi in his first address to the nation ""Greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated""❓ 
Now we can judge the greatness and moral progress of @anurakumaraofficial

This Government believes the recent animal census where 2,600,000 Giant Squirrels were counted in just 300 seconds by naked eyes, by ordinary people with no experience in wildlife. How Is this realistic❓

If this is how they intend to Govern the country not only animals but even the human will be in alot of trouble.

Didnt Anura Kumara qoute Gandhi in his first address to the nation ""Greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated""❓ 
Now we can judge the greatness and moral progress of @anurakumaraofficial

This Government believes the recent animal census where 2,600,000 Giant Squirrels were counted in just 300 seconds by naked eyes, by ordinary people with no experience in wildlife. How Is this realistic❓

If this is how they intend to Govern the country not only animals but even the human will be in alot of trouble.

Didnt Anura Kumara qoute Gandhi in his first address to the nation ""Greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated""❓ 
Now we can judge the greatness and moral progress of @anurakumaraofficial

This Government believes the recent animal census where 2,600,000 Giant Squirrels were counted in just 300 seconds by naked eyes, by ordinary people with no experience in wildlife. How Is this realistic❓

If this is how they intend to Govern the country not only animals but even the human will be in alot of trouble.

Didnt Anura Kumara qoute Gandhi in his first address to the nation ""Greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated""❓ 
Now we can judge the greatness and moral progress of @anurakumaraofficial

This Government believes the recent animal census where 2,600,000 Giant Squirrels were counted in just 300 seconds by naked eyes, by ordinary people with no experience in wildlife. How Is this realistic❓

If this is how they intend to Govern the country not only animals but even the human will be in alot of trouble.

Didnt Anura Kumara qoute Gandhi in his first address to the nation ""Greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated""❓ 
Now we can judge the greatness and moral progress of @anurakumaraofficial

This Government believes the recent animal census where 2,600,000 Giant Squirrels were counted in just 300 seconds by naked eyes, by ordinary people with no experience in wildlife. How Is this realistic❓

If this is how they intend to Govern the country not only animals but even the human will be in alot of trouble.

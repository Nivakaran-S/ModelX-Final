Didnt Anura Kumara qoute Gandhi in his first address to the nation ""Greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated""❓ 
Now we can judge the greatness and moral progress of @anurakumaraofficial

This Government believes the recent animal census where 2,600,000 Giant Squirrels were counted in just 300 seconds by naked eyes, by ordinary people with no experience in wildlife. How Is this realistic❓

If this is how they intend to Govern the country not only animals but even the human will be in alot of trouble.

Didnt Anura Kumara qoute Gandhi in his first address to the nation ""Greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated""❓ 
Now we can judge the greatness and moral progress of @anurakumaraofficial

This Government believes the recent animal census where 2,600,000 Giant Squirrels were counted in just 300 seconds by naked eyes, by ordinary people with no experience in wildlife. How Is this realistic❓

If this is how they intend to Govern the country not only animals but even the human will be in alot of trouble.

Didnt Anura Kumara qoute Gandhi in his first address to the nation ""Greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated""❓ 
Now we can judge the greatness and moral progress of @anurakumaraofficial

This Government believes the recent animal census where 2,600,000 Giant Squirrels were counted in just 300 seconds by naked eyes, by ordinary people with no experience in wildlife. How Is this realistic❓

If this is how they intend to Govern the country not only animals but even the human will be in alot of trouble.

Didnt Anura Kumara qoute Gandhi in his first address to the nation ""Greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated""❓ 
Now we can judge the greatness and moral progress of @anurakumaraofficial

This Government believes the recent animal census where 2,600,000 Giant Squirrels were counted in just 300 seconds by naked eyes, by ordinary people with no experience in wildlife. How Is this realistic❓

If this is how they intend to Govern the country not only animals but even the human will be in alot of trouble.

Didnt Anura Kumara qoute Gandhi in his first address to the nation ""Greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated""❓ 
Now we can judge the greatness and moral progress of @anurakumaraofficial

This Government believes the recent animal census where 2,600,000 Giant Squirrels were counted in just 300 seconds by naked eyes, by ordinary people with no experience in wildlife. How Is this realistic❓

If this is how they intend to Govern the country not only animals but even the human will be in alot of trouble.

Didnt Anura Kumara qoute Gandhi in his first address to the nation ""Greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated""❓ 
Now we can judge the greatness and moral progress of @anurakumaraofficial

This Government believes the recent animal census where 2,600,000 Giant Squirrels were counted in just 300 seconds by naked eyes, by ordinary people with no experience in wildlife. How Is this realistic❓

If this is how they intend to Govern the country not only animals but even the human will be in alot of trouble.

""Women make up more than 50% of our population, yet their presence in politics remains far too low. If we truly believe in democracy, then we must also believe that leadership should reflect the people. And that means giving space, support, and encouragement for more women to step into political roles. Talent has no gender and when women lead, communities thrive.

At the same time, we as young people have a responsibility. We can't keep blaming the system if we’re not willing to be part of the change. Politics isn’t just about power,  it’s about service. If we want better policies, better futures, and real representation, then we must step up, speak out, and get involved.

Change begins when we stop waiting for others and start becoming the voice that drives it.""

""Women make up more than 50% of our population, yet their presence in politics remains far too low. If we truly believe in democracy, then we must also believe that leadership should reflect the people. And that means giving space, support, and encouragement for more women to step into political roles. Talent has no gender and when women lead, communities thrive.

At the same time, we as young people have a responsibility. We can't keep blaming the system if we’re not willing to be part of the change. Politics isn’t just about power,  it’s about service. If we want better policies, better futures, and real representation, then we must step up, speak out, and get involved.

Change begins when we stop waiting for others and start becoming the voice that drives it.""

The voting determined the makeup of local councils across the island, and the outcomes signaled that while President Anura Kumara Dissanayake continues to enjoy popular support, his honeymoon period may be nearing its end.⁠
⁠
The series of polls began last September, when Dissanayake—popularly known as AKD—swept to power on a lasting wave of discontent following the collapse of Sri Lanka’s economy in 2022. That crisis saw the country default on its international debt amid soaring cost-of-living conditions and a currency collapse, leading to public protests that unseated then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.⁠
⁠
As the longtime leader of the traditionally marginalized leftist party Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, or JVP, Dissanayake was perceived as a political outsider, positioning him well in the runup to the first presidential election since the 2022 protests, known as the Aragalaya movement. His JVP-led National People’s Power, or NPP, alliance subsequently earned a supermajority in November’s parliamentary elections, winning 159 seats out of 225 on 62 percent of the vote.⁠
⁠
In the local elections held earlier this month, the NPP still won the largest vote share, taking over councils in the Sinhala heartlands and upcountry areas. But it fell to 43 percent overall, raising the question of where Dissanayake’s NPP government stands after six months in power.⁠

The voting determined the makeup of local councils across the island, and the outcomes signaled that while President Anura Kumara Dissanayake continues to enjoy popular support, his honeymoon period may be nearing its end.⁠
⁠
The series of polls began last September, when Dissanayake—popularly known as AKD—swept to power on a lasting wave of discontent following the collapse of Sri Lanka’s economy in 2022. That crisis saw the country default on its international debt amid soaring cost-of-living conditions and a currency collapse, leading to public protests that unseated then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.⁠
⁠
As the longtime leader of the traditionally marginalized leftist party Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, or JVP, Dissanayake was perceived as a political outsider, positioning him well in the runup to the first presidential election since the 2022 protests, known as the Aragalaya movement. His JVP-led National People’s Power, or NPP, alliance subsequently earned a supermajority in November’s parliamentary elections, winning 159 seats out of 225 on 62 percent of the vote.⁠
⁠
In the local elections held earlier this month, the NPP still won the largest vote share, taking over councils in the Sinhala heartlands and upcountry areas. But it fell to 43 percent overall, raising the question of where Dissanayake’s NPP government stands after six months in power.⁠

""கூட்டுச் சேர்ந்தவர்கள் அனைவரும் படிப்படியாகச் சிறை செல்லப் போகிறார்கள் என்பது அவர்களுக்குத் தெரியும். பாதாள உலகக் குழுக்களை இயக்கியவர்கள் இவர்கள். இன்று வெளிநாடுகளில் தங்கியிருந்த நிலையிலும் அவர்கள் கைது செய்யப்பட்டுள்ளனர்,"" என்று இளங்குமரன் கூறினார்.

மேலும், ""புலனாய்வுப் பிரிவையும், பொலிஸ் பிரிவையும் நாங்கள் சுயாதீனமாக இயங்க விட்டிருக்கிறோம். கடந்த காலங்களில் அரச அழுத்தங்களால் இத்தகைய நடவடிக்கைகள் எடுக்கப்படவில்லை. இவர்களின் கைதுக்குப் பிறகு பல அரசியல்வாதிகளின் பெயர்கள் தெரியவர உள்ளன. தேசிய மக்கள் சக்தி அரசாங்கத்தின் மீது மக்களுக்கு அளவுகடந்த நம்பிக்கை உள்ளது. சட்டம் தன் கடமையைச் செய்யும்போது, இந்த கூட்டங்கள் இல்லாமல் போய்விடும்,"" என்றும் அவர் தெரிவித்தார்.

The voting determined the makeup of local councils across the island, and the outcomes signaled that while President Anura Kumara Dissanayake continues to enjoy popular support, his honeymoon period may be nearing its end.⁠
⁠
The series of polls began last September, when Dissanayake—popularly known as AKD—swept to power on a lasting wave of discontent following the collapse of Sri Lanka’s economy in 2022. That crisis saw the country default on its international debt amid soaring cost-of-living conditions and a currency collapse, leading to public protests that unseated then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.⁠
⁠
As the longtime leader of the traditionally marginalized leftist party Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, or JVP, Dissanayake was perceived as a political outsider, positioning him well in the runup to the first presidential election since the 2022 protests, known as the Aragalaya movement. His JVP-led National People’s Power, or NPP, alliance subsequently earned a supermajority in November’s parliamentary elections, winning 159 seats out of 225 on 62 percent of the vote.⁠
⁠
In the local elections held earlier this month, the NPP still won the largest vote share, taking over councils in the Sinhala heartlands and upcountry areas. But it fell to 43 percent overall, raising the question of where Dissanayake’s NPP government stands after six months in power.⁠

The voting determined the makeup of local councils across the island, and the outcomes signaled that while President Anura Kumara Dissanayake continues to enjoy popular support, his honeymoon period may be nearing its end.⁠
⁠
The series of polls began last September, when Dissanayake—popularly known as AKD—swept to power on a lasting wave of discontent following the collapse of Sri Lanka’s economy in 2022. That crisis saw the country default on its international debt amid soaring cost-of-living conditions and a currency collapse, leading to public protests that unseated then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.⁠
⁠
As the longtime leader of the traditionally marginalized leftist party Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, or JVP, Dissanayake was perceived as a political outsider, positioning him well in the runup to the first presidential election since the 2022 protests, known as the Aragalaya movement. His JVP-led National People’s Power, or NPP, alliance subsequently earned a supermajority in November’s parliamentary elections, winning 159 seats out of 225 on 62 percent of the vote.⁠
⁠
In the local elections held earlier this month, the NPP still won the largest vote share, taking over councils in the Sinhala heartlands and upcountry areas. But it fell to 43 percent overall, raising the question of where Dissanayake’s NPP government stands after six months in power.⁠

The voting determined the makeup of local councils across the island, and the outcomes signaled that while President Anura Kumara Dissanayake continues to enjoy popular support, his honeymoon period may be nearing its end.⁠
⁠
The series of polls began last September, when Dissanayake—popularly known as AKD—swept to power on a lasting wave of discontent following the collapse of Sri Lanka’s economy in 2022. That crisis saw the country default on its international debt amid soaring cost-of-living conditions and a currency collapse, leading to public protests that unseated then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.⁠
⁠
As the longtime leader of the traditionally marginalized leftist party Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, or JVP, Dissanayake was perceived as a political outsider, positioning him well in the runup to the first presidential election since the 2022 protests, known as the Aragalaya movement. His JVP-led National People’s Power, or NPP, alliance subsequently earned a supermajority in November’s parliamentary elections, winning 159 seats out of 225 on 62 percent of the vote.⁠
⁠
In the local elections held earlier this month, the NPP still won the largest vote share, taking over councils in the Sinhala heartlands and upcountry areas. But it fell to 43 percent overall, raising the question of where Dissanayake’s NPP government stands after six months in power.⁠

The result is that at parliamentary elections in November, all the country’s districts bar one gave the National People’s Power sweeping and respectable majorities – more or less giving the lie to Wickremesinghe’s claims of having achieved economic and political stability under his watch.

This is a two-part article on the implications of Ranil Wickremesinghe’s arrest.

The National People’s Power made several insinuations about the Rajapaksas stealing money in the run-up to last year’s elections, but members of the family have not yet been questioned about them.

The National People’s Power can claim, not unjustifiably, that those allegations were swept under the carpet – a crucial part of their anti-elite discourse. Yet, even considering this, it seems plausible that if they are not proven, or if they end up nowhere, or if the economy falters while the National People’s Power pursues these cases, the allegations will end up re-legitimising the political old guard.

If that happens, it seems likely that the biggest winner will not be Ranil Wickremesinghe – who is reported to be suffering from several health challenges and has not indicated whether he is returning to politics – but rather a scion of the Rajapaksas. That increasingly appears to be Mahinda Rajapaksa’s active, colourful, and controversial son Namal.

But it is certainly a very impressive turnaround. From around 1970 until 2021, Sri Lanka seemed to be on an irreversible track toward steadily worsening governance: grand corruption, disregard of the law, ethnic and religious conflict, state violence and (non-military) government incapacity and incompetence. Today, by contrast, following the September 2024 presidential and the November 2024 parliamentary elections, the prospects for more substantive democracy and better governance seem bright.

The old political elite and the broader politician class have been replaced almost completely through the most peaceful and fair elections that the country has seen for a long time. The prospect of military intervention in politics has entirely faded. The female proportion of MPs doubled from a very low 5% in a year when the global trend was in the other direction.

The new National People’s Power government, with 67% of parliamentary seats, shows every sign of intending to reduce corruption, obey the law, respect expertise, negotiate political solutions to pressing problems and generally rule in accord with the instincts of the educated, middle class professionals who provide so much of its ideological and organisational heft. 

Mick Moore analyses structural and historical causes and explains what brought about a hopeful change in Sri Lanka.

The result is that at parliamentary elections in November, all the country’s districts bar one gave the National People’s Power sweeping and respectable majorities – more or less giving the lie to Wickremesinghe’s claims of having achieved economic and political stability under his watch.

This is a two-part article on the implications of Ranil Wickremesinghe’s arrest.

The National People’s Power made several insinuations about the Rajapaksas stealing money in the run-up to last year’s elections, but members of the family have not yet been questioned about them.

The National People’s Power can claim, not unjustifiably, that those allegations were swept under the carpet – a crucial part of their anti-elite discourse. Yet, even considering this, it seems plausible that if they are not proven, or if they end up nowhere, or if the economy falters while the National People’s Power pursues these cases, the allegations will end up re-legitimising the political old guard.

If that happens, it seems likely that the biggest winner will not be Ranil Wickremesinghe – who is reported to be suffering from several health challenges and has not indicated whether he is returning to politics – but rather a scion of the Rajapaksas. That increasingly appears to be Mahinda Rajapaksa’s active, colourful, and controversial son Namal.

But it is certainly a very impressive turnaround. From around 1970 until 2021, Sri Lanka seemed to be on an irreversible track toward steadily worsening governance: grand corruption, disregard of the law, ethnic and religious conflict, state violence and (non-military) government incapacity and incompetence. Today, by contrast, following the September 2024 presidential and the November 2024 parliamentary elections, the prospects for more substantive democracy and better governance seem bright.

The old political elite and the broader politician class have been replaced almost completely through the most peaceful and fair elections that the country has seen for a long time. The prospect of military intervention in politics has entirely faded. The female proportion of MPs doubled from a very low 5% in a year when the global trend was in the other direction.

The new National People’s Power government, with 67% of parliamentary seats, shows every sign of intending to reduce corruption, obey the law, respect expertise, negotiate political solutions to pressing problems and generally rule in accord with the instincts of the educated, middle class professionals who provide so much of its ideological and organisational heft. 

Mick Moore analyses structural and historical causes and explains what brought about a hopeful change in Sri Lanka.

Meeting with India’s External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar, Finance Minister, and Lok Sabha Speaker, Sajith highlighted a pragmatic and forward-looking approach to rebuilding trust and regional partnerships.

India’s continued support - including the USD 4.2 billion lifeline during our economic crisis - is a reminder that strong diplomacy begins with mutual respect and shared progress.

Sajith’s proposal to deepen parliamentary exchanges and explore energy and connectivity collaborations shows a leader who understands that Sri Lanka’s recovery depends on smart regional integration.

This visit is not about politics - it’s about future stability, investment confidence, and strategic friendship. A timely, statesmanlike move. 🌏✨

Following the court’s decision, Wickremesinghe was transferred to a prison hospital due to reported health concerns. The case has sparked widespread debate across the country, further deepening political tensions.

Authorities allege that Wickremesinghe misappropriated public money while in office, a charge that has intensified scrutiny of Sri Lanka’s governance and accountability systems.

The development marks another chapter in the island nation’s ongoing political and economic challenges, with citizens closely watching how this case unfolds.

The result is that at parliamentary elections in November, all the country’s districts bar one gave the National People’s Power sweeping and respectable majorities – more or less giving the lie to Wickremesinghe’s claims of having achieved economic and political stability under his watch.

This is a two-part article on the implications of Ranil Wickremesinghe’s arrest.

The charges stem from a September 2023 trip to London, where Wickremesinghe attended his wife’s graduation ceremony at the University of Wolverhampton. Authorities claim the visit, presented as part of an official state tour, was privately funded and misused approximately Rs. 16.9 million (about $50,000) in public money. 

This marks a significant moment in Sri Lankan politics, as Wickremesinghe becomes the first former head of state in Sri Lanka to be arrested

Meeting with India’s External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar, Finance Minister, and Lok Sabha Speaker, Sajith highlighted a pragmatic and forward-looking approach to rebuilding trust and regional partnerships.

India’s continued support - including the USD 4.2 billion lifeline during our economic crisis - is a reminder that strong diplomacy begins with mutual respect and shared progress.

Sajith’s proposal to deepen parliamentary exchanges and explore energy and connectivity collaborations shows a leader who understands that Sri Lanka’s recovery depends on smart regional integration.

This visit is not about politics - it’s about future stability, investment confidence, and strategic friendship. A timely, statesmanlike move. 🌏✨

Following the court’s decision, Wickremesinghe was transferred to a prison hospital due to reported health concerns. The case has sparked widespread debate across the country, further deepening political tensions.

Authorities allege that Wickremesinghe misappropriated public money while in office, a charge that has intensified scrutiny of Sri Lanka’s governance and accountability systems.

The development marks another chapter in the island nation’s ongoing political and economic challenges, with citizens closely watching how this case unfolds.

The result is that at parliamentary elections in November, all the country’s districts bar one gave the National People’s Power sweeping and respectable majorities – more or less giving the lie to Wickremesinghe’s claims of having achieved economic and political stability under his watch.

This is a two-part article on the implications of Ranil Wickremesinghe’s arrest.

The charges stem from a September 2023 trip to London, where Wickremesinghe attended his wife’s graduation ceremony at the University of Wolverhampton. Authorities claim the visit, presented as part of an official state tour, was privately funded and misused approximately Rs. 16.9 million (about $50,000) in public money. 

This marks a significant moment in Sri Lankan politics, as Wickremesinghe becomes the first former head of state in Sri Lanka to be arrested
